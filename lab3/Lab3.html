            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I worked as a marketing assistant in a private high school, and then I chose to work in a factory for manual labor because of diabetes, which was good for my health.</br> 
                After working in the factory for a year, I returned to China for a few months for family reasons.</br> 
                When I returned to Canada, I wanted to learn something that I was personally interested in, so I chose CIT.</br> 
                I hope that my study career at BCIT will allow me to find a relaxed and stable job.
